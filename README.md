# Jadavpur University Photographic Club

About Us :
JUPC, one of the oldest student-run clubs in Asia, is the official photography club of Jadavpur University running since its foundation in 1964. The club, through the years, has won many laurels - both national and international and has seen many of its members become prominent professionals in the field of photography. The club that started off in a washroom of the Geology department, now also maintains its own studio and dark-room. It also accommodates a library that gives access to a collection of books and journals concentrating on both National and International circuits of Photography.

The club has a full-scale training programme for JU students with existing members as trainers and guides. It invites speakers for introduction and exposure to newer approaches in photography. Besides, the club has associated itself with Photography Workshops like Foundry Photojournalism Workshop and even conducted National Salons, International Salons, National Contests, International Contests and organised Photo-Fests. Alongside these highlights, there are regular interactive sessions in clubs and annual trips and treks for photography organised by the club. The club not only practises photography as an art but also takes on commercial projects. The club even is entrusted with the duty of photography for the Convocation of the University.

JUPC not only forms a hub of pupils interested in photography but also creates a nexus of members and acquaintances all over the globe that enriches photographic practices in the niche of the University that has inspired generations to be innovative and interested to explore the realm of photography.
